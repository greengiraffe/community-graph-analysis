# Community Graph Analysis

A custom web-based social network and graph analysis tool developed as part of my master thesis titled "Graph-based Analyses of Online Community Structures".

This is a monorepo holding a Python back end in `./server` and a Preact front end in `./frontend`. The `scripts` folder contains several jupyter notebooks, the PostgreSQL 13 database backup (without data) and other tools.

Refer to the `README.md` files in the respective subfolders for installation and build information.
